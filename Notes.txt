Environment
------------
To run our project we need infrastructure that is called as Environment of the project.

Machine with OS.
Web/Application Server
DB Server etc.,

For our application we need several environments like below:

DEV(devlopers),QA(Tester) and UAT(client) Environments.

In Company,these environments will be created by DevOps team.

We will use these environments to test our application

-> Developers will use DEV environment to perform Dev Integration Testing.
-> Testers will use QA environment to perform software Testing.
-> Client/Client side team members will use UAT environment to perform acceptance testing.
-> Pilot/Staging is called as pre-production (To Check application behaviour with live data).
-> Production environment is used Deliver the project(Live Env).
-> If application is deployed to Prod env end users can access the project.


Build & Deployement Process:
------------------------------

1) Take latest code from repo.
2) Compile source code.
3) Do code review.
4) Execute Junits.
5) Package code as jar/war.
6) Deploy application to server.

earlier admin people will use 6 steps manually.but nowadays Jenkins tool used.

once Build & Deployment is completed we can access that project in our machine using url of the environment to perform Testing.
